My biggest issue was communication. I ordered 5 bags for myself and my bridesmaids for my upcoming wedding and wanted personalized writing on the bags. Nowhere in the listing did it indicate that there was a character limit, or that I would be upcharged for a larger bag if I exceeded that character limit. I actually used a phrase that is advertised in one of the listing pictures, but was informed there would be an additional surcharge because the writing wouldn't fit. Ultimately, I had to pay an extra $24 for 3 larger bags, but the seller did use the same larger bag for my 2 remaining items for free. Just be aware of this when placing your order."

I bought the large size, and there is plenty of room for my laptop, charger, and a few (small) 1‚Äù binders and folders, etc. I‚Äôm very confident that this bag will last for years if not decades (with proper leather care of course). All in all, I couldn‚Äôt be happier!"
