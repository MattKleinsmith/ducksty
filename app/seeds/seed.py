My biggest issue was communication. I ordered 5 bags for myself and my bridesmaids for my upcoming wedding and wanted personalized writing on the bags. Nowhere in the listing did it indicate that there was a character limit, or that I would be upcharged for a larger bag if I exceeded that character limit. I actually used a phrase that is advertised in one of the listing pictures, but was informed there would be an additional surcharge because the writing wouldn't fit. Ultimately, I had to pay an extra $24 for 3 larger bags, but the seller did use the same larger bag for my 2 remaining items for free. Just be aware of this when placing your order."

I am constantly showering myself with gifts (because who else knows what I like better than myself?!) and let me just say that this is next level gorgeous. I am an avid reader, and I love The Little Prince sooo much that my original copy has 70% of the pages falling out. So when I saw this light, I KNEW I must have it. I cannot stress enough how perfect it is. Even as good as the photos make this look, they do not do it justice, so imagine it about 10,000 times more amazing. I just got it, and honestly, I cannot tear my eyes away; I just keep staring at the whole thing. I am over the moon thrilled with this purchase and 100% satisfied with my care. Infinity % recommend. Synopsis: GET IT. I guarantee you will not be disappointed. It's truly lovely."
